# Given an array of numbers, write a function that prints in the console another arraywhich contains all the even numbers in the original array, which also have even indexes only.
#       ○ Test 1: getOnlyEvens([1, 2, 3, 6, 4, 8]) prints [ 4]
#       ○ Test 2: getOnlyEvens([0, 1, 2, 3, 4]) prints [0, 2, 4]
#  Test1


# Question 2
# ● Create a function that takes a two-digit number as an parameter and prints "Ok" inthe console if the given string is greater than its reversed digit version. If not, the function will print "Not ok"
#      ○ Test 1: reverseCompare(72) prints "ok" because 72 > 27
#      ○ reverseCompare(23) prints "Not ok", because 23 is not greater than 32

# def reverseCompare(num):
#     reversed_num = int(str(num)[::-1])
#     if num>reversed_num:
#         print("ok")
#     else:
#         print("not ok")
# reverseCompare(72)
# reverseCompare(23)

#  Question 3
# ● Write a function that takes a positive integer and returns the factorial of the number. Notes: The factorial of 0 is 1. Ex: factorial seven is : 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 × 5 × 6 × 7. The factorial of any positive integer x is x * (x - 1) * (x - 2) * . . . . . . * 1 (ex: factorial of 4 is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24)
#     ○ Test 1: returnFactorial(5) outputs 120
#     ○ Test 2: returnFactorial(6) outputs 720
#     ○ Test 3: returnFactorial(0) outputs 1
def returnFactorial(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    
    factorial = 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        factorial *= i
    return factorial

print(returnFactorial(5))
print(returnFactorial(6))
print(returnFactorial(0))
